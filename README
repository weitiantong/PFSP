To compile the program, please go to the folder "code" and use the command "make".
The executable file is called flowshopWCT.
Several arguments can be provided to run the program.

The arguments are:
--instance #path_of_the_instance
--algo #{sa or grasp}
--time #time_limit_in_milliseconds
--seed #seed_for_random_generator

Organisation of the code:

- The implementation of the metaheuristic are in the file "stochasticls.cpp"
- These algorithms are based on the construction methods implemented in "construction.cpp" and on the iterative improvement methods implemented in "localsearch.cpp"
- The command line arguments are extracted in the function in "utils.cpp"

The seed used for the the random generator for the tests are:
12345, 67891, 01112, 13141, 51617
